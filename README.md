# Surprise-based exploration with a model-based architecture
This is the code repository for my thesis.

#### Contents
- Experiments for combining an autoencoder with a prediction model in the latent space
- Experiments for extracting uncertainty in deep neural networks (MC dropout and bootstrap)
- A3C implementation with the surprise-based exploration method (running Atari games)

#### TODOs
