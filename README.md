# Intrinsic Motivation in Reinforcement Learning with Deep Dynamics Models
This is the code repository for my master's thesis.

#### Contents
- [Experiments for combining an autoencoder](https://github.com/mrminy/Master_Thesis/tree/master/autoencoder_experiments) with a prediction model in the latent space in Atari environments
- [Experiments for extracting uncertainty in deep neural networks](https://github.com/mrminy/Master_Thesis/tree/master/uncertainty_experiments) (MC dropout and bootstrap) in simple regression tasks
- [MB-PAAC](https://github.com/mrminy/Master_Thesis/tree/master/mb_paac) implementation, where PAAC is combined with a deep dynamics model for extracting different intrinsic reward bonuses.


##### MB-PAAC requirements
- Python (3.4+)
- TensorFlow (1.0+)
- Keras (1.2+)
- scikit-image
- cython
- numpy
- python3-tk
- [ALE](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)
- matplotlib
